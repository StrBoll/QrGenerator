# QrGenerator
QR Generator that allows user to save QR codes as .svg or .png files from any link 

# if you are using an IDE like pycharm, then the file with your chosen name will save into the IDE project folder, not onto the desktop
I will use 3 properties to generate a QR code for your link
First, Error is used to set the error correction level

Second, Mode sets the unique way in which the contents (your link) will be encoded

Third, Version is used to specify data and size capacity

Although this program is quite simple and short, it's main objective is to prove my own prowess in Python. I can do
anything imaginable, a good coder is someone who is willing and able to find any solution to any problem via their own research and logic.
